##How get the template.

Well, first you have to clone this repo. Just use the "git clone" command.

##How to use it.

To start to use it after clone it, you have to run npm install and then create a firebase account at https://firebase.google.com/?hl=es-419. Once you create your acount, you should can create a new database with you appKey and all that stuff. Soooooo, just put that config on the firebase.js file inside the Firebase template.

And that's it my friend, just run npm start to use it and set it.
